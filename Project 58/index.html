     <p> My favourite hobbies are reading and painting. I am 11 years old and I study in grade 6. I love to read story books whenever I am free especially nowadays as I get really bored, some of my favourite series are Harry Poter, Nancy Drew and A to Z Mysteries.I also like to do paint as I also like to mix colours and make more beautiful colors, painting also increases one's creativity it also makes a person relax whereas reading makes a person more knowledgable and confidence and of course stories are also very fun to read</p>
